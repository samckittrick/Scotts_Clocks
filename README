This is a space themed clock "face" for the monochron clock kit by Adafruit Industries.

The speed of the station can be adjusted by changing the value of SECONDS_PER_PIXEL.

The ground track and station locations are simulated using the following equation:
Y = 27 + floor( 20sin( Radians_PER_PIXEL*(x+36)))
